About:
[Project Name] is a opensource tool designed to allow users to submit and sign [Content Name]. A signature is an indication 
of support for the particular [Content Name]. Signatures are displayed on the page with the original [Content Name]. 
[Content Name] is a node while signatures are comments. By utilizing nodes and comments the relationship between signatures 
and [Content Name] can be maintained while leveraging the builtin authentication and review system built into the comment 
system. Business logic is implemented with the Workflow module which contains many conditions and triggers that can 
customize the maintainance of currating of the [Content Name] and signatures.
